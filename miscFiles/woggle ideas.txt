Woggle to do:

X. Highlighting finished tiles.
    1. Finishing things up only after dictionary complete.
    2. Replace list with dictionary values: It's the same thing.
    3. Make sure values are ordered in find words.
    4. Build in highlight functions.

X. Below foundwords at end, display found N out of M in T(ime).

X. Delete redundant coreData stuff

X. Some UI info when new stat is made.
Clear this after settings change/new game

X. Implement a way to associate and view the board associated with a given stat.
    Here, saving boards gets a little difficult.
    At the moment, I have cascade delete on gameInstance.
    And, with an updated stat I want to keep a copy of the board associated with the gameInstance.
    So, either I need to avoid cascade delete, or do a deep copy of the board.

X. It would be cool to show 'exhausted' tiles.
    And, this is kind of easy to do.
    Maybe.
    I can get a list of tiles used when searching for possible words.
    Store these.
    Well, I kind of want a relation.
    Which means a matrix.
    Rows are tiles.
    Colums are words.
    When I make a word, I set each cell with the tile to true.
    When a word is found, all of these are set to false.
    Then, when a word is made I check each row to see if there's a true cell.
    If not, then there's no available word which uses the tile.
